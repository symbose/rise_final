    <h4> To the challenge! </h4>
    <h1> Parent Info </h1>
    <p> Welcome to RISE!! This is an interactive game-like teaching tool for younger children. Our aim is to install good waste reduction habits at a young age to positively affect our planet. This earth is the only planet we've got (for now!) so let's all do our best to preserve her! </p>
    <p> This web application is used by checking boxes every time your child does something environmentally friendly (such as use a reuseable water bottle instead of a single use plastic one, composting leafovers from meals, ect.). Checking these boxes gives you points, and when you reach a point goal, the fish avitar at the bottom of the screen grows! </p>
